### RemoveChatCensor (by BlueAmulet, based on Souzooka's patch)

Other players will still see your message as censored unless they also have this patch.

### MouseJitterFix (by Souzooka)
MouseJitterFix reduces mouse jerkiness for those suffering from the "mouse jittering" bug.  
This current solution does not solve the issue, but removes >99.5% of jittering.  
Jittering still seems to occur very rarely on its own, or in some cases where the user is clicking a lot (e.g. with an autoclicker) or has low performance.
