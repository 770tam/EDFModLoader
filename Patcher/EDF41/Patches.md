### ChangeFOV (by BlueAmulet, based on Souzooka's EDF5 patch)
ChangeFOV lets you change the game's FOV from it's default of 45 vFOV.  
Various presets are included in the ChangeFOV.txt file, see reddit post for image previews.  
Based on this [reddit post](https://reddit.com/r/EDF/comments/d7mjhw/has_there_been_an_fov_hack_yet/f17bbwn/) by Souzooka, ported to EDF4.1 and added values for other FOV values.
